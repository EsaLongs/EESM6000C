This is a brent kung adder. It can be synthesized as any bits of 2 ^ n. (4, 8,16 , 32, 64, 128 ....).
The essential files are "Brent_Kung_Adder_nbit.sv", "define.sv" and "pg_unit.sv". You can set the bits you want in "define.sv". You can also integrate them in one file by yourself.
Here shows the schematic of this kind of adder with setting size to be 32 bit. It shows that we use 57 gp_units in total and is equal to original algorithm's value (16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 15 = 57).
